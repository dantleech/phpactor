Clients
=======

The RPC clients integrate Phpactor into your editor, they currently provide
more features than the language server (but you can use both).

.. note::

    For a list of :doc:`lsp` clients, see :doc:`lsp`.

- :doc:`vim-plugin`.
- `Emacs <https://github.com/emacs-php/phpactor.el>`__.
