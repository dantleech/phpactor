History
=======

**Note**: The following is personal history and opinion.

--------------

I developed Phpactor because I am a VIM (and Linux console) user, and
every year that passed (there were many of them) I noticed that the
relative stupidity of my editor grew more and more as IDEs such as
Jetbrains `PhpStorm <https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/>`__ and Idea
platforms offered more and more great features.

VIM is a great text editor, but it is essentially ignorant of the
meaning of code. Nevertheless, I still *felt* that I could program
faster and more efficiently in VIM running in
`Tmux <https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki>`__ sessions in a minimal
tiling desktop environment such as `I3 <https://i3wm.org/>`__. I became
extremely good at typing, and developed muscle memory for class
constructors and properties.

Not having these refactoring tools however also meant that the lack of
them would have a direct influence on the quality of my code and
architecture (if would take an hour to move a bunch of classes, the
chances are I probably wouldn’t do that).

Of course there were a multitude of ways to mitigate this lack of
functionality and for some time I had, for example, been using ctags
completion (basically regexy “dumb” completion) and code snippet
generators, but a real contextually aware code completion and
refactoring tool for PHP was simply not available.

I was excited to find out about projects like
`Padawan <https://github.com/padawan-php/padawan.php>`__ and other
similar efforts, but they all seemed either unstable or sub-optimal (at
the time at least) and after a while I thought “how hard can it be”? So
in 2014 I wrote the first version of Phpactor. It was failed. 1 year
later I wrote another, it sucked. The ongoing third effort is what we
have here today.

One of the things that made Phpactor possible was the Microsoft
`Tolerant PHP
parser <https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser>`__ (TPP), a
great library which offers a practical and fast AST. At this time I also
discovered the Microsoft Language Server protocol, and Felix Beckers
`PHP Language
Server <https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server>`__. This
was awkward as the language server was a solid effort and the overlap
between it and Phpactor was apparent. But I decided to carry on - I had
previously waited for other projects and they didn’t mature.

Initially I also used the `Nickic PHP
parser <https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser>`__ - the defacto PHP parser
in the PHP world today, but I found the TPP much easier to work with as
it provides node tree-traversal (and was matched to Phpactor’s use case
- I *believe* it was Initially created to support the `VS
Code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code>`__ eco-system.

It is also worth mentioning that the backbone of Phpactor is
`worse-reflection <https://github.com/phpactor/worse-reflection>`__,
which was influenced by
`BetterReflection <https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection>`__.
BetterReflection is an awesome project by the
`Roave <https://roave.com/>`__ team to provide a static alternative to
the SPL Reflection library. Initially Phpactor used this library, but as
Phpactor had different requirements, it would have been painfully slow
progress to incrementally contribute the experimental functionality.
worse-reflection has gone through many iterations and continues to be
unstable, it is the core domain of Phpactor and is subservient to its
needs.

Why not PHP Language Server?
----------------------------

No reason - PHP language server is great. But there are some
differentiators:

-  **Phpactor is realtime**: It does not index anything. This is both
   good and bad, good because it is fast (depending on the operation),
   doesn’t suffer from memory issues and has no start-up penalty. It
   uses short lived processes, which is what PHP is classically good at.
   We locate files quickly by depending on the
   `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`__ autoloader. Bad because it
   cannot discover non-autoloadable classes or (at time of writing)
   provide completion for functions in the wild. Phpactor still works
   without composer by traversing your project tree, but it’s speed is
   then relative to project size.
-  **Phpactor is also a refactoring tool**: Phpactor provides
   `refactorings <refactorings.md>`__ and procedures to help you code
   faster and more accurately (such as complete constructor, generate
   method, implement contracts etc).
-  **Phpactor ships with a VIM plugin**: Phpactor ships with a `VIM
   plugin <vim-plugin.md>`__.

Why not Language Server Protocol?
---------------------------------

The `Language Server
Protocol <https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol>`__
defines a standard protocol for an editor to talk to a language server.
Phpactor is fills the role of a language server, but it’s essentially a
PHP script.

Phpactor currently implements its own `RPC Protocol <rpc.md>`__, this at
least gives it flexibility. But it would be great to eventually either
replace this with LSP or provide an LSP interface and therefore be a
generic backend for all editors with LSP support.
