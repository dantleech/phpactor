Phpactor is an intelligent code-completion and refactoring tool and language
server for PHP.

-  **Code Completion**: Provides broad and accurate context aware code
   completion.
-  **Introspection**: Jump to class and method definitions, find
   references.
-  **Refactoring**: Move classes, complete constructors, implement
   contracts, generate methods, etc.
-  **Language Server**: Language Server Protocol implementation.
-  **Native VIM plugin**: Lightweight VIM plugin.
-  **CLI interface**: Some functionality is exposed through CLI commands.

Phpactor can be used in a limited way as a **standalone application**,
but its full power can only be utilized through its :doc:`other/rpc` protocol or
through its :doc:`usage/language-server`.

Phpactor is pronounced “factor”, as in “factorisation” and “re-factoring”.
