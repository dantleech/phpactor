Language Server
===============

.. container:: alert alert-danger

   The Language Server is currently experimental and currently supports
   only a small amount of the functionality covered by Phpactorâ€™s own
   RPC protocol.

Phpactor has some initial support for running as a server supporting the
`Language Server
Protocol <https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification>`__.

There are many clients which can be used both for VIM and other editors.

Getting Started
---------------

Try it out as follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ phpactor server:start -vvv

You should see something like:

::

   Starting TCP server, use -vvv for verbose output
   Phpactor handlers:: textDocument/completion, textDocument/definition
   [2018-09-30 17:15:25] phpactor.INFO: listening on address 127.0.0.1:8888 [] []
   [2018-09-30 17:15:25] phpactor.INFO: starting language server with pid: 9286 [] []

This is the language server running in TCP mode, which is great for
debugging, but when configuring your client you may want to invoke the
server in STDIO mode. *your client* should invoke Phpactor as:

.. code:: bash

   $ phpactor server:start --stdio
