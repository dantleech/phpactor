Debugging RPC
-------------

When executing commands in an editor, it can be tricky to consistently
reproduce errors, or to isolate and debug them in Phpactor.

Thankfully there is a feature called RPC replay which allows you to
replay the last RPC command received by Phpactor.

Enable it in a Phpactor configuration file, for example
``$HOME/.config/phpactor/phpactor.yml``:

.. code:: yaml

   rpc.store_replay: true

Now, after you execute an RPC command via. your editor, you can execute
Phpactor from the shell and replay your last command:

.. code:: bash

   $ phpactor rpc --replay 
   {"action":"open_file","parameters":{"path":"\/home\/daniel\/www\/phpactor\/phpactor\/lib\/Extension\/Rpc\/Handler\/AbstractHandler.php","offset":447}}

To see more information, including the initial request add the
``--verbose`` option:

.. code:: bash

   $ phpactor rpc --replay --verbose
   [2018-05-23T22:14:11.486488+02:00] phpactor.DEBUG: REQUEST {"action":"goto_definition","parameters":{"source":"[removed]","offset":1913,"path":"/home/daniel/somepath/SomeClass.php"}}
   [2018-05-23T22:14:11.494201+02:00] phpactor.DEBUG: Resolving: Microsoft\PhpParser\Node\Statement\ClassDeclaration [] []
   [2018-05-23T22:14:11.494545+02:00] phpactor.DEBUG: Resolving: Microsoft\PhpParser\Node\Parameter [] []
   ...[truncated]...
   [2018-05-23T22:14:11.508019+02:00] phpactor.DEBUG: RESPONSE {"action":"open_file","parameters":{"path":"/home/daniel/www/phpactor/phpactor/lib/Extension/Rpc/Handler/AbstractHandler.php","offset":447}} []
   {"action":"open_file","parameters":{"path":"\/home\/daniel\/www\/phpactor\/phpactor\/lib\/Extension\/Rpc\/Handler\/AbstractHandler.php","offset":447}}

The next time you run a command, you will lose your replay, in order to
consistently reproduce an action, you can copy the replay file and
execute it consistently as many times as required:

.. code:: bash

   $ cp ~/.local/share/phpactor/replay.json .
   $ cat replay.json | phpactor rpc --verbose

Logging
-------

Logging is disabled by default, but can provide some useful information
(such as errors encountered when parsing files etc).

Enable it as follows:

::

   logging.enabled: true
   logging.level: DEBUG
   logging.path: phpactor.log
